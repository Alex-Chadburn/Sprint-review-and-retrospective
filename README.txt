# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Interpreting the user's needs comes from understanding the user first. If they have a specific issue, you should check what the issue is and get clarification
if you can. Some user stories overlap and they give more direction as to how you might implement these requirements. For example in the SNHU Travel backlog the users
gave suggestions that somewhat overlapped and you can categorize them as new filters for trips.  

## How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When developing programs, the first thing you need is a bit of background information. How exactly does my program interact with other things? What kind of data do
I have and what data do I need? How do I know when I should do X, Y, and Z? Some Agile processes I hope to incorporate would be Scrum Events and CI/CD.

### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means more than just writing code, changing backlogs, or testing code. To be a good team member you need to participate in the Scrum events, 
collaborate with team members, communicate effectively, take accountability for your tasks, and continuously learn new technologies and best practices.
